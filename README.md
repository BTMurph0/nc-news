To run this project locally after cloning:

1. Using .env-example as a template, in the root folder create a file called .env.test then another called .env.development.

2. Edit the files so they contain the database names - the database names can be found in the /db/setup.sql file.

3. Make sure the env files are ignored by adding their filenames to the .gitignore file.
